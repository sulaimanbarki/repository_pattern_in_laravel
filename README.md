##How to Use the Repository Pattern in a Laravel Application

A repository can be defined as a layer of abstraction between the domain and data mapping layers, one that provides an avenue of mediation between both, via a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

Modern PHP frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony, interact with databases via Object-relational mappers (ORMs); Symfony uses Doctrine as its default ORM and Laravel uses Eloquent.

Both take different approaches in how database interaction works. With Eloquent, Models are generated for each database table, forming the basis of interaction. Doctrine, however, uses the Repository pattern where each Entity has a corresponding repository containing helper functions to interact with the database. While Laravel doesn't provide this functionality out of the box, it is possible to use the Repository pattern in Laravel projects.

A key benefit of the Repository pattern is that it allows us to use the Principle of Dependency Inversion (or code to abstractions, not concretions). This makes our code more robust to changes, such as if a decision was made later on to switch to a data source that isn't supported by Eloquent.

It also helps with keeping the code organized and avoiding duplication, as database-related logic is kept in one place. While this benefit is not immediately apparent in small projects, it becomes more observable in large-scale projects which have to be maintained for many years.
